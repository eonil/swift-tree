/// A container that oganizes elements in tree-shape.
///
/// Non-`Collection` Type
/// --------------------
/// A `Tree` is not a `Collection` type automatically.
/// An implementation of `Tree` can also implement `Collection`,
/// but it's not required.
///
/// Root-Less
/// ---------
/// `Tree` can be empty. Empty state have no root,
/// and you need to insert root explicitly.
///
/// Path Base Access
/// --------------
/// You can access element using paths.
/// You have to use correct paths when you  insert/remove elements
/// into/from trees. Paths are secondary indices just like keys in dictionaries.
///
/// Sorted Path Iteration
/// ---------------------
/// You can iterate sorted paths from `paths` property.
/// Iterating over sorted paths takes *O(n * log(n))* time.
///
/// Subtree Structure Query
/// -----------------------
/// You can query subtree structure recursively
/// via `subtree` property.
///
/// - Complexity:
///     As Swift standard library treats `Dictionary` complexity O(1),
///     I just follow that consumption for all time complexity notations
///     in this library.
///     - Treat hash-table access as O(1).
///     - Persistent variant can take log(n) more time for all each operations.

    ///     Complete Binary Tree and can use simple `Int` index
    ///     without sacrificing navigatability. In that case,
    ///     path-based operations can provide O(1) time.
